# Portfolio Project for DCI's Orientation Course

Our final project during the 2-week web develpoment course was to create a personal portfolio page.

I decided to experiment with bold colors and graphic elements that interact with the mouse in order to create a fun but informative website.

The website needs still some touches in order to function 100% as I would like to:
* fix mobile view
* better placement of graphic elements to not overlap text
* more interaction with the graphic elements - more animations
* jump to top section at the bottom: font is not displayed properly
